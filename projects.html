        This is a knockoff of Facebook with a lot of functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built using MVC framework with Ruby on Rails, styled with Bootstrap, deployed on Heroku. When you sign up, you have the option to create a new account or login via Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        I generated a mailer to welcome user when they create a new account.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I used Omniauth to allow login via Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>   
        I used AWS S3 via Active Storage to allow an attachment/update of an avatar photo. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a relational database to store users, posts, comments, friend requests, friendships, and likes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use this by logging in with:
      </p>
      <p>
        Email: 'test@test.com'
        Password: 'password'
      </p>
      <p>
        Or feel free to create an account/login with Facebook!

        The classic game of Battleship.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project I utilized TDD with Jest.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Packaged everything with Webpack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Created custom CSS with animations and responsive design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using factory functions, modular design and a lot of event listeners, I created a
        functional game that works well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I allowed the player to place ships with their mouse. They can click the orientation
        button to flip between 'x' and 'y', and click to place the ship. I included logic to
        not allow ships to overflow off the board, and also not overlap another ship.
      </p>
      <p>
        When placing ships, the squares are highlighted to show where they will be placed, and
        once placed, the ship renders on the board so the player knows where other ships are located.

        This is a game to test your memory.

      <p>
        Built using React hooks, deployed on Github pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Play by clicking each card only once. If you select the same card twice, your score will go to 0 and you will get an alert stating that you selected a card twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use event listeners to listen for a click on each card, modify state to ackowledge that this card has been chosen, then each click checks whether that card has been selected yet or not.

        A ToDo list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, I created a TO DO list using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and webpack.
        I wrote the code in modules so that I could write clean, maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        All tasks/projects are saved locally using LocalStorage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects are listed in tabs on the top, which have an event listener for deletion as well as selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each task is color-coded based on priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tasks can be created, edited, and deleted.

        A command line chess game.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can either play this game locally if you have ruby installed, or play it on my repl.it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you play on repl.it, in the command line on the right, type "cd lib", then hit "enter". Then type "ruby game.rb".
      </p>
      <p>
        If you play on locally, in the command line, navigate to chess/lib then type "cd lib", then hit "enter". Then type "ruby game.rb".
      </p>
      <p>
        The game should allow you to play through. If you're playing locally, you can save the game at any time. I did this usling yaml.
