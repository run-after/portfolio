          This is a fullstack photo tagging app that has you find all given characters in a photo.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built using React functional components on the front-end and Firebase on the back-end, deployed
          on Github Pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Created custom CSS with animations and responsive design.
        </li>
        <li>
          This app utilizes Firebase Firestore, Firebase Storage, and Firebase authorization.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the user begins, they choose a map, then a timer is started. The timer begins when the start button is pressed
          and continues until the final character is found.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the app starts, an anonymous account is generated, their score is placed into the database,
          then the anonymous account is logged out, and the database is cleaned up.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the user completes the task faster than someone on the top 10 scoreboard, 
          they are placed onto the scoreboard
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the final character is found, the time taken is calculated from timestamps from the database, so no cheating
          can take place.

        <li>
          The classic game of Battleship.
        </li>
        <li>
          In this project I utilized TDD with Jest.
        </li>
        <li> 
          Packaged everything with Webpack, deployed on Github Pages.

        <li>
          Using factory functions, modular design and a lot of event listeners, this app is a
          functional game that works well.
        </li>
        <li>
          The player can place ships with their mouse. They can click the orientation
          button to flip between 'x' and 'y', and click to place the ship. Logic was included to
          not allow ships to overflow off the board, and also not overlap another ship.
        </li>
        <li>
          When placing ships, the squares are highlighted to show where they will be placed, and
          once placed, the ship renders on the board so the player knows where other ships are located.
        </li>
        <li>
          Computer ships are placed randomly.

          Play by clicking each card only once. If player selects the same card twice, 
          their score will go to 0 and they will get an alert stating that they selected a card twice.
        </li>
        <li>
          Event listeners were used to listen for a click on each card, modify state to ackowledge that 
          this card has been chosen, then each click checks whether that card has been selected yet or not.

        <li>
          You can either play this game locally if you have ruby installed, or play it on my repl.it.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you play on repl.it, in the command line on the right, type "cd lib", then hit "enter". Then type "ruby game.rb".
        </li>
        <li>
          If you play on locally, in the command line, navigate to chess/lib then type "cd lib", then hit "enter". Then type "ruby game.rb".
        </li>
        <li>
          The game should allow you to play through. If you're playing locally, you can save the game at any time. I did this usling yaml.
