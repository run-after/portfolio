        This is a knockoff of Facebook. I made this fairly basic, but with a lot of functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Built using Ruby on Rails, deployed on heroku. When you sign up, you have the option to create a new account or login via Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        I generated a mailer to welcome you when you create a new account.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I used Omniauth to allow you to login via Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>   
        I used AWS S3 via Active Storage to allow an attachment/update of an avatar photo. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I styled the site using Bootstrap.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created a relational database to store users, posts, comments, friend requests, friendships, and likes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can use this by logging in with:
      </p>
      <p>
        Email: 'test@test.com'
        Password: 'password'
      </p>
      <p>
        Or feel free to create an account/login with Facebook!

        A ToDo list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, I created a TO DO list using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and webpack.
        I wrote the code in modules so that I could write clean, maintainable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        All tasks/projects are saved locally using LocalStorage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects are listed in tabs on the top, which have an event listener for deletion as well as selection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each task is color-coded based on priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tasks can be created, edited, and deleted.

        A virtual library.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, I used JavaScript and HTML/CSS to create an app that allows you to add books to your virtual library.
        The library is saved locally via LocalStorage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used event listeners to give you the ability to change the 'read' status, as well as delete the book once already in
        the library. There is a button to add new books to the library as well as a modul that pops up to fill in the fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also used event listeners to hide/show class styles as in the form for it to pop up and an image that explains to
        press the 'add' button, but the image only shows when there are no books in the library.
